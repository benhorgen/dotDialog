A Dialog based micro framework: Platform bindings translate Element based objects into native UI objects


Mission:  Unite a dialog framework that translates 'elements' into native UI objects.  This enables developers to utilize a portion of the UI code across multiple targeted platforms (such as iOS, Android, ASP.NET web apps, etc).  

Key Notes:  The three dialog repos are submodules to other developers github repos.  The direction of each of those dialog frameworks includes friendly collaboration and doesn't always keep compatibility between them.  This can be worked out over time.  We can manage that via github and a desire to be API compatible.  :-)

Example:  There is repo which explores how the three frameworks can be utilized for portable code.  The example is rudimentary, but demonstrates how Dialog UI can be utilized for some cross platform UI.  Here is the github link (author: benhorgen). https://github.com/benhorgen/MonoCross-Example.git

This is a work in progress.
